# Doors
A Game project for my coding class. It's a bootleg OS game where you play games to buy more games. It's inspired by Loading Screen Simulator, and Progressbar.

This project is currently pretty buggy, I seriously did everything in a weird way.

Windows
- I called every window using a function instead of making it one window that just switched graphics, and to be fair. This was was easier
- Tried Making Classes for Sprites and animations like my QuitAnim, and that worked. But when I tried to do the Loading Door... it broke.


Collisions
- I Made a function for Graphics.
      Then I make a Variable that called the Rect for the Image and I'd get it's collision from that Variable
-If that wasn't bad enough, I turned EVERY IMAGE I used into a Variable! Like I'm sure there was a better way...


Anyway I learned a lot from this Project and I hope to continue this and make it better through the next year!
